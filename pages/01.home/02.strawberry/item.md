Relive the groovy 60's in our popular Strawberry Fields lake house. Nestled in the Monroe/Brown County hills on beautiful Lake Lemon, Strawberry Fields is chock full of 60's memorabilia and Beatles' tributes, and has served as Family Fun Central for scores of vacationing families since the 1960's.

Outside this informal yellow and red family fun hideaway is a boat dock and swimming/beach area, as well as a large yard and hot tub with a panoramic view of the lake. Strawberry Fields is perfect for families and large gatherings, and offers the ultimate in kid-friendly accommodations with its gently sloped access to the lake, and a large but flat backyard that is ideal for throwing Frisbee or playing croquet. For the adults there is a unique double swing accommodating six sitting right on the water - a delightful place to sip a cold drink, chat and watch the sun set.
