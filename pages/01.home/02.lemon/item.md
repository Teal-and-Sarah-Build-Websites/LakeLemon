Want a vacation with a twist? Check out this comfortable lakeside cottage on beautiful, secluded Lake Lemon. This quaint and relaxed family vacation property sleeps seven with a queen bed on the main floor, a queen-sized futon in the living room, and a walk out bedroom with a double and single bed downstairs.

Enjoy a refreshing lakeside breeze from the comfort of two rocking chairs on the wraparound porch. Many guests love watching the sunset from the breathtaking western view. There are also kayaks for your use, a convenient whirlpool/shower upstairs, and a hot tub on the lower level for blissful relaxation after a busy day of shopping and touring in nearby Nashville or Bloomington.
