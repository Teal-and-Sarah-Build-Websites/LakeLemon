title: 'How can I get involved?'
---
We're still working on getting campaign infrastructure in place.  In the mean time, if you want to get ahold of us to find out how to get involved you can reach out to us at [danielbinghamforbloomington@gmail.com](mailto:danielbinghamforbloomington@gmail.com) You can also follow along on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/danielbinghamforbloomington/?ref=br_rs) page!  At this point in the campaign, our main challenge is just getting on people's radar. So liking and sharing the page and its posts is a huge help.  Also spreading the word about us, especially to folks you know in District 2.

In the coming weeks, we'll be putting together canvasing infrastructure and looking for volunteers to help.  We'll also be looking for folks to host house parties where people can come and meet Daniel.  If you live in District 2 and would be interested in hosting a house party, please reach out through either the email or the Facebook page.
