Treat yourself to a Monroe/Brown County getaway off the beaten path. Our two Lake Lemon hideaways are all located just one mile west of Brown County and are perfect for that family vacation you're planning. Our properties, Lemon Lift and Strawberry Fields, are right on the lake with dock access, kayaks and swimming areas.

Conveniently located just 11 miles from Nashville's shops, restaurants, and the Brown County State Park, and the same distance from the diverse nightlife and excitement of Monroe County and Bloomington, home of Indiana University, there is no shortage of fun to be found.
